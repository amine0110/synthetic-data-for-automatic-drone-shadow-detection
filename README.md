# Synthetic Data for Automatic Drone Shadow Detection
This repository is related to my PhD paper; the code available here is for creating synthetic data for drone shadow detection.

The code consists of taking a png format of the drone shadow and superimposing it on various backgrounds, some of which were captured with the drone's vertical camera and others with a phone camera.

Using thisÂ script, you can generate as much data as you want with their corresponding bounding boxes.
